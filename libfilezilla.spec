%description
libfilezilla is a free, open source C++ library, offering some basic
functionality to build high-performing, platform-independent programs.
Some of the highlights include:

* A typesafe, multi-threaded event system that's very simple to use yet
  extremely efficient.
* Timers for periodic events.
* A datetime class that not only tracks timestamp but also their accuracy,
  which simplifies dealing with timestamps originating from different sources.
* Simple process handling for spawning child processes with redirected I/O.
